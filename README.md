Control Pad for Nokia N9

This app is an effort to learn Qt and QML by implementing a control pad. My goal is to create an extensible control pad library that can be included in games. Along the way though, there may be code that is inefficient or completely off base. However, suggestions and comments are welcome

Unless otherwise specified, all code is under the BSD license.
